# Machine Learning from scratch (torch)

## About
Python and Torch based implementations of some of the basic Machine/Deep Learning algorithms.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired from the original numPy version [ML-From-Scratch](https://github.com/eriklindernoren/ML-From-Scratch) repository by [eriklindernoren](https://github.com/eriklindernoren). This project was done as a means to learn the Torch library. In effect, you could say this repo is a clone of the original numPy based repository but written in purely Torch instead of numPy.
