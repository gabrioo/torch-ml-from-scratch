# Machine Learning from scratch (torch)

## About
Python and Torch based implementations of some of the basic Machine/Deep Learning algorithms.

## Inspiration
This project was inspired from the original numPy version ML-From-Scratch repository by eriklindernoren. It was done as a means to learn the Torch library. In effect, you could say this repo is a clone of the original numPy based repository but written in Torch instead of numPy.
